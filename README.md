## Getting Started

<!-- ## MAIN UI IS Made using https://chakra-ui.com/   -->

## First, run the development server

## Technologies And Framework used ❤️‍🔥

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): The React Framework
  for Production
- [Chakra ui🤩 ](https://chakra-ui.com//): chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

## Installation

- If you wish to run your own build, first ensure you have Nodejs globally installed in your computer. If not, you can get [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)

- ## Step1

- Then, Git clone this repo

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zax4r0/web_jarvisos.git
  ```

- ## Step 2

- change directory to your the cloned repo as such:

  ```bash
    cd web_jarvisos
  ```

- ## Step 3

- change directory to your the cloned repo as such:

  ```bash
    npm install
  ```

- ## Run It 🚀

  🔥 Fire up the server using this one simple command:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
  ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
